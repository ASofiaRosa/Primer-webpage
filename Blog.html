          <h2>1. Frankenjura</h2>
          <p>What else should we say about the Frankenjura? That it is the best sport climbing area in Germany? With the toughest routes? Incredible variety? Holey dolomite that turns easy routes into grippy indulgences on the vertical? Has over 700 rocks with over 7000 routes? Plus lots of small breweries and cute places? You probably already know all this. And the rest of the climbing world now knows it too. We'll say it again anyway: The Frankenjura is a climbing dream!

          <h2>2. Elbsandstein</h2>
          <p>On the way from the Czech Republic to Dresden, the Elbe cuts through a huge sandstone plateau. Smaller streams have eroded a rocky landscape from this plateau to the left and right of the Elbe, which seems made for climbing. There are over 1000 dark sandstone peaks. Their walls seem to be perfectly flat, but if you take a closer look, they are structured, showing cracks, heels, handles and steps. No wonder that climbing has been going on here for over 100 years, that free climbing and difficulty rating were invented here. And that the reputation of the Elbe sandstone as an extraordinarily beautiful and impressive climbing area has spread all over the world.

        <div class='Pfalz right'>
          <h2>3. Pfalz</h2>
          <p>Again and again, bold, red-grey rock towers protrude from the hilly forests, inviting you to climb, many of them free-standing and with a magnificent view. Between Pirmasens and Landau is the largest and most famous climbing area in Rhineland-Palatinate. In the Palatinate, rocks up to 60 meters high made of dark red colorful sandstone lure with many climbing challenges: compact walls, honeycombed weathering, cracks, slabs, roofs. In short: The southern Palatinate is a climbing paradise.

          <h2>4. Blautal</h2>
          <p>Around the small town of Blaubeuren west of Ulm, the limestone of the Swabian Alb is once again at its best. Compact, flat, with holes and dents, but also steep and exhausting in places: the 30 or so rocks with walls up to 50 meters high are equally attractive for beginner climbers and experienced climbers alike. Short ascents and the possibility to turn off directly to the ice cream parlor or the outdoor pool after visiting the rock are further plus points. In relation to other rocks, the Blautalfels scores with compactness and is less brittle.

        <div class='Schwarzwald right'>
          <h2>5. Schwarzwald</h2>
          <p>Once it was a real mountain range, today it only has hills - albeit quite high ones. The Black Forest has long been known as a hiking destination. For climbers, with the exception of the Battert, it has so far been of more local importance. That changes, the more information about the mountain range on the Rhine leaks out. With gneiss, granite, sandstone and porphyry, the Black Forest has a rock diversity that is second to none. And you don't have to be an extreme person to enjoy rock climbing in the many crags. This is especially true for the Battert.
